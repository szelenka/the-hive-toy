# The HIVE

This project contains the [CircuitPython 7.1.0][7] code for the toy made for our kids.

This toy is running on a [Feather M4][1], [PN532 NFC/RFID controller][2], [Speaker][3], some
[NeoPixels][4] and a recycled SD Card reader from an old radio. The [PN532][2] and SD Card reader
share the same [SPI][12] bus, and is powered by a [3.7v 2200mAh][14] battery.

The basic functionality is described in this[YouTube Video][5].

## Functionality

- reading RFID chip embedded in a 3D printed spherical animal
- selecting a random WAV file associated with the RFID tag
- playing audio file where the relative [SPL][6] changes the brightness of the LEDs
- low-battery indicator (lights and sound)
- on/off switch
- random input/output ramps 

## Requirements
For the code to run on the [Feather M4][1], you'll need to include these libraries:
- [adafruit_bus_device][8]
- [adafruit_pn532][9]
- [adafruit_sdcard][10]
- [neopixel][11]

## 3D printing assets

Available on [PrusaPrinters][16].

## Notes

Debugging was performed with [Mu Python][13]. 

Originally we wanted to have the audio files mix in real-time if multiple RFID tags were 
detected in one of the 4 ramps. However, the hardware limitations of the [PN532][2] only 
allows for 2 tags to be read at the same time. 

The [Speaker][3] had interesting feedback when operated on a battery and the voltage was 
not at it's peak. Where leveraging the [audiomixer][15] from CircutPython produced a constant hiss.

Designing the ramps to print on the [Prusa Mini][17] while also adhearing to the [Rhombic Dodecahedron ][18]
design and accomidating the [PN532][2] antenna was challenging. There are still a few locations where the balls
could get "stuck", but are easily nudged out. 

Modeling the geometric shapes in [Fusion 360][19] was very straight-foward, however the character ball designs
was easier to perform in [blender][20] with Sculpting. Although we had to design the screw pattern and negative 
space in [Fusion 360][19] to then import into [blender][20] such that we could take the negative boolean of the 
two models to get a consistent print which allowed us to screw them together after inserting the RFID tag.

Painting the ball figures was pretty straight-forward, although protecting the paint from repeated bouncing off the
ramps is still TBD.
